# Sammon Embedding

This repository is an implementation of Sammon Embedding algorithm for dimensionality reduction.

The idea of Sammon Embedding algorithm is very simple: to preserve the distance between points as much as possible. More formally, we have *N* vectors defined as $$X_i$$, where $$N = 1, 2, ..., N$$.
